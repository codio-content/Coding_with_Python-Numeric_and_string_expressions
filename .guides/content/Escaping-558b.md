Sometimes you will need to use special characters in your strings which Python would normally recognise as code. To do this you should "escape" the characters, which means telling Python not to interpret them as code, but as a string element instead.

## The `'` character
Look at the following string:

```python
This is Shahneila's PC
```

We are not able to code this as: 

```python
str = 'This is Shahneila's PC'
```

because Python thinks that the `'` in `Shahneila's` is the end of the string.

The solution is to *escape* the character. This lets Python know that we want to use the `'` as part of the string.

```python
str = 'This is Shahneila\'s PC'
```

You can see how we put the `\` character before the `'`. This is know as *escaping* the character.

## Inserting a new line
Another time you might find escaping useful is when you want to insert a new line into your text.

Look at the code on the left and you can see that `\n` escape is used to insert a new line.

(The `\n` for *newline* or *line feed* and `\r` for *carriage return* are from the days of electric typewriters. A *carriage return* slides the assembly back to the start of the line and *line feed* moves down one line.)

## Useful escapes
The following list shows you some typical uses of escaped characters. 

| Escape Sequence | Description |
|-|-|
|\'|	Single quotation mark|
|\"|	Double quotation mark|
|\\|	Backslash|
|\b|	Backspace|
|\f|	Form feed|
|\n|	New line|
|\r|	Carriage return|
|\t|	Horizontal tab|
